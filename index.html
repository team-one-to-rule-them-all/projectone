                    Middle-earth, spreading all over the continent and developing a variety of cultures and ethnicities.
                    Unlike Tolkien's elves, Men are

                    of Anduin. Most of their race eventually founded the land of the Shire.</p>

                    before the First Age and served him and later his successor in their quest to dominate Middle-earth.
