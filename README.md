# Description

This browser application allows a user select a Lord of the Rings character race, then see a cocktail recipe based on the selection. The user can then rate the drink and see the selection history in a table on the screen.

Upon accessing the web application, the user is shown instructions for the application workflow. The user can either click a link or scroll to view their Lord of the Rings character selection options, which live at the bottom of the page. The user may then select a characer race to move to the next page, which is the loading screen.

On the loading screen, the user is shown a random quote from the Lord of the Rings series. Additionally, a loading bar is surfaced to indicate that the page will change shortly. No user input is required to advance to the final page of the application.

On the final page, the user is assigned a character based on the race selection made on the instructions screen. This character is known as the user's "drinking companion", and the user may click a link to learn more about that character. Below the drinking companion information, the name of the drink, instructions, ingredients, and measurements are displayed. The user may follow these instructions, then rate the drink on a one-to-five star scale. Finally, the user may review a table of saved drinks, companions, and ratings. The user may clear this table or can start over to choose another character and generate another recipe.
